# Image-Compression
A web app built on **Flask** that lets users upload images and download the compressed image.
Uses **Huffman Coding** to compress the bits of each pixel generated using **MinHeaps** in C.

## Steps:
1. Covert image to text.
2. Compress the text using Huffman Coding.
3. Convert the compressed text back to Image.

It is a lossless compression technique and works on all types of image files.
